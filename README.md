# eamil-automation-with-unique-attachements

You can use this code to automate the mailing process and save tons of time.
You need not to install any library all the library needed for this script to run are preinstalled. you  might need to install pandas.  
use and excel file to provide the name email ids, etc then load it with the help of pandas.
Paste all the documents in the current working folder with proper naming sequence.
Or you can also give the path of the attachemnets in the excel file.
I have used  for loop to pick ids and select the unique attachements for every person.

Email me for any difficulty!!!
I would really aprreciate if you help me to improve this script.
Thanks!!!
